Hello world! Week one devlog

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings? 

They are float variables because their applied values (numbers) have decimals for increased precision.

2. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?

 Bounce counts the number of bonds and, therefore, as a tracker, needs to track full numbers.

4. The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?

 The line of code was missing a semicolen,part two taught us how inportant it is to add the semicolen.
