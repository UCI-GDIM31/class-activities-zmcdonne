### W1
Hello world! Week one devlog

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings? 

They are float variables because their applied values (numbers) have decimals for increased precision.

2. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?

 Bounce counts the number of bonds and, therefore, as a tracker, needs to track full numbers.

4. The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?

 The line of code was missing a semicolen,part two taught us how inportant it is to add the semicolen. 

 ### week 3 in class

 I was on table 14 this class, and we discussed the prompt we were given suronding sanity and lighting and how we would programm it. The parameter would be the player’s sanity level, and the output would control the lighting level. If the method doesn’t need to return anything, the return type could be void. The parameter (the player’s sanity level) would determine changes in the lighting level.


In class, my group and I came up with a metaphor to represent classes, components, variables, and numbers.
We chose the analogy of a skinwalker and the skins they collect. The component is the skinwalker, and the classes are the skins. A skinwalker uses different skins, just like a component uses different classes. The numerical variables determine the behavior, and the number of variables in a class influences how the component acts.Methods define how something acts, while variables and numbers represent their traits to be more spesific. 

We don’t set a limit on the brightness of the ball and therfor it keeps getting brighter. 

### week 4
1. What solution did you come up with for the collider activity, and why? Solutions such as fitting the collider to the object, locking the Z and X axes where the main issues occur, and forgetting to submit something as a trigger. Specifically, which objects did you add Rigidbodies to, and which object(s) did you check Is Trigger on? Trigger on the goal, Rigidbodies were added to everything because those are the objects that need physics. If your game did not work perfectly the first time you tested it, talk about what you had to fix. I needed to make the collider fit the items better, lock in the correct axes, and remember to set the goal as a trigger.
